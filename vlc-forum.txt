I can reproduce this issue under Windows 10 with VLC 3.0.8 Vetinari, not under MacOS. I haven't tried Linux; if someone believes this is important, I'll do. I cannot reproduce this issue with m4a/aac and ogg/opus files.

Here is what I am doing:
[list=1]
[*]Start with new settings by moving C:\Users\someUser\AppData\Roaming\vlc to C:\Users\someUser\AppData\Roaming\vlc_old
[*]Have a network drive at a remote location.
[*]Have some audio files of different types (mp3, ogg/opus, m4a/aac) with approximately the same overall bitrate.
[*]Have a connection bandwidth capable of handling the played audio files within one or two seconds when copying with Windows Explorer.
[*]Connect to the network drive using SMB 2 via Windows Explorer (enter URL \\networkurl\share) and provide the credentials.
[*]Drag and drop the mp3 file to the playlist.
[*]Starting playback.
[/list]

Here is what I see (and hear):
[list=1]
[*]Buffering is much slower compared to ogg/opus and m4a/aac in spite of similar bitrates
[*]Playback starts and lasts for a couple of seconds
[*]Playback interrupts and buffering starts (very slowly again)
[*]Playback starts and lasts for a couple of seconds
...
[/list]

At pastebin.ubuntu.com is log of 
[list=A]
[*] m4a playback: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/gZMtXgqkx4/
[*] mp3 playback: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/fwkmrw9hjb/
[/list]

And I have captured some traffic with Wireshark. I have also full capture files and recorded a video from screen, however it may contain sensitive data and I am only willing to share it with developers if they agree on an NDA. The video features the Wireshark and the VLC messages window running in parallel.

Here are some screenshots. The most obvious part: Much more yellow in the mp3 capture. This means the initial SMB packets/TCP packets ratio is increased. The overall number of packets in the mp3 capture is also much higher compared to the m4a.



Increasing buffering durations in settings does not really help: Longer playback but also longer breaks within one title.
